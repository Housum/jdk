Navigable 接口,这个接口主要设计为定位元素的,扩展自SortMap
```
/**
 * 1.扩展自SortMap的一个接口并且添加了很多的搜索最接近指定目标，以下的方法:
 * {@code lowerEntry}, {@code floorEntry}, {@code ceilingEntry},{@code higherEntry}
 * 返回低于,低于或等于,高于或等于,高于的元素，如果没有查找到元素的话,那么返回null，同理
 * {@code lowerKey}, {@code floorKey}, {@code ceilingKey}, {@code higherKey} 返回最近的Key
 * 这些方法都是设计成定位元素的（不是遍历map）
 * 
 * 2.NavigableMap能够通过正序或者倒叙的方式进行操作和便利，方法descendingMap方法
 * 返回的就是一个倒序的NavigableMap，但是正序的操作可能会被倒叙的操作速度会更快
 * 这个类中的{@code subMap}, {@code headMap}, {@code tailMap} 和SortMap中同名
 * 的方法是不同的，它包含了一个boolean的参数，可以选择性的指定是否包含右边(大的一方)
 * 并且他的subMap返回的必须是NavigableMap！
 *
 * 3.增加的方法@code firstEntry}, {@code pollFirstEntry}, {@code lastEntry},  {@code pollLastEntry} 
 * 可以返回或者删除最大或者最小的值，如果不存在的话,那么返回null
 * 
 * 4.对于所有返回的元素都介意实现于Map.Entry并且不要实现setValue方法，但是可以通过
 * put方法修改关联的值
 *
 * <p>Methods
 * {@link #subMap(Object, Object) subMap(K, K)},
 * {@link #headMap(Object) headMap(K)}, and
 * {@link #tailMap(Object) tailMap(K)}
 * are specified to return {@code SortedMap} to allow existing
 * implementations of {@code SortedMap} to be compatibly retrofitted to
 * implement {@code NavigableMap}, but extensions and implementations
 * of this interface are encouraged to override these methods to return
 * {@code NavigableMap}.  Similarly,
 * {@link #keySet()} can be overriden to return {@code NavigableSet}.
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
